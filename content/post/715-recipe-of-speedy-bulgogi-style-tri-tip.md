recipeingredient:
- "3-4 pound tritip cut into 2inch wide strips"
- " For the marinade"
- "1 cup lite or low sodium soy sauce"
- "1/2 cup sugar"
- "3 Tablespoons brown sugar"
- "3 Tablespoons water"
- "2-3 Tablespoons minced garlic to taste"
- "2 green onions chopped"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1 Tablespoon distilled white vinegar or 14 cup apple sauce as a tenderizer"
- "1 Tablespoon toasted sesame oil"
- "1 Tablespoon neutral oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir or whisk until sugar is dissolved. Some soy sauces are saltier than others. If your marinade&#39;s too salty, try adding 1 teaspoonful of water at a time to dilute the saltiness to taste. Keep in mind as you&#39;re tasting, though, that the juices from the meat will also dilute the flavors."
- "Let the meat marinate for at least 1 hour. 3 to 6 hours or so ideally. 90 minutes before you&#39;re going to grill it, take it out of the fridge to bring the meat up to room temp. Meat almost always cooks better at room temp. (I mean, unless it&#39;s a crazy hot or crazy cold day, of course...)"
- "Grill over a pre-heated medium grill for about 3 minutes per side for something medium rare-ish. (And on these really chunky strips, when I say side, I mean all four of them.)"
- "Let the meat rest for 7 to 10 minutes before slicing."
- "Enjoy!"
