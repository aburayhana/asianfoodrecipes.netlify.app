Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, meat gratin. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Meat Gratin is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Meat Gratin is something which I have loved my whole life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

And although it qualifies as a one-pan meal (with meat, green vegetable and starch altogether), a fresh and tangy green salad on the side would round things out nicely. Stir in the tomato paste and season to taste with salt and pepper. In order to beef up our gratin (pun intended), we decided to add some deliciously seasoned beef, along with some onion and garlic, and then pair it all together with deliciously creamy and cheesy potatoes. This recipe comes from a famous New Orleans restaurant but I don&#39;t remember which one!


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook meat gratin using 4 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you cook it.
