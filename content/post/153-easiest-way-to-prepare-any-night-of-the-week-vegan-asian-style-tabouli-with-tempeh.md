- "1/3 cup Barley"
- "1/3 cup Adzuki beans boiled"
- "1 cup Fresh spinach leaves"
- "1/4 Red onion"
- "1/4 cup Parsley"
- "1/4 cup Cilantro"

- "1 Freshly cut corn on the Cobb"
- "1 tbsp Apple cider vinegar"
- "1/2 Lemon freshly squeezed"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil"
- "1 tbsp Honey"
- "1/2 packages Tempeh"
recipeinstructions:
- "When I cook barley I usually make it in larger proportions so I can get multiple dishes out of it. The ratios are the same as rice (2 to 1). I used I cup of barley to 2 cups of water and brought it to a boil. Once boiling turn off heat and steep. You can use it while warm but I prefer to leave it in the fridge over night so it&#39;s nice and cool in my tabouli."
- "Cooking Adzuki beans is easy and you can find them in any health store. I buy mine in the bulk sectional whole foods. These beans have a smoky aroma to them when cooked and go great with any Asian style dish. Just like the barley I cook these in larger batches to get multiple meals out of them. Bring to a boil in a large pot and let simmer for one hour until fully cooked."
- "Cook tempeh over medium heat until edges are brown in sauté pan."
- "Chop and dice all other ingredients in a large bowl"
- "Sauce - add sesame oil , honey , lemon, and apple cider vinegar. Mix throughly"
