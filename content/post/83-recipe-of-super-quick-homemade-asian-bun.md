recipeingredient:
- "500 grams allpurpose flour"
- "8 grams active dry yeast"
- "325 ml warm water"
- "3/4 teaspoon salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "To a mixing bowl of an electric mixer using a dough hook attachment, stir to dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let sit for 5 minutes. add the flour and salt. Knead the dough until it forms a smooth dough ball. The dough should feel soft and easy to work with."
- "Cover the dough, and let it proof at room temperature for about an hour or until it doubles in size."
- "After proofing, punch the dough to get rid of any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Cover the dough balls with a kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out while you’re shaping the buns."
- "To shape the buns, take each dough ball and roll it out into a cigar-like shape. Next, roll it out into a longer and narrower strip, and fold it in half lengthwise. Roll it up into a bundle, with the loose end tucked underneath. Turn it on its side so the swirls are facing up, and press it down with your palm. Now roll it out into a disc about 4 inches in diameter. Repeat these steps for all of the dough balls. (See the picture to see how to shape the dough)."
- "Place the shaped buns on a lightly floured baking sheet. Cover the shaped buns with a dry kitchen towel, and let rest for 20 minutes before cooking."
- "Pre-heat an electric griddle or you can use a flat bottomed pan over medium heat. Place the buns in the pan about an inch apart (no oil is necessary) and let the buns cook for 2 minutes on each side. The heat shouldn’t be too high, or your buns may burn. After cooking the buns for 2 minutes on each side, and cook each side for another minute or so until the entire bun is golden brown."
