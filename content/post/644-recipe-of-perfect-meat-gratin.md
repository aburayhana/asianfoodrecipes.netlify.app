Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, meat gratin. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Meat Gratin is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Meat Gratin is something that I have loved my whole life.

And although it qualifies as a one-pan meal (with meat, green vegetable and starch altogether), a fresh and tangy green salad on the side would round things out nicely. Stir in the tomato paste and season to taste with salt and pepper. In order to beef up our gratin (pun intended), we decided to add some deliciously seasoned beef, along with some onion and garlic, and then pair it all together with deliciously creamy and cheesy potatoes. This recipe comes from a famous New Orleans restaurant but I don&#39;t remember which one!


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have meat gratin using 4 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.
