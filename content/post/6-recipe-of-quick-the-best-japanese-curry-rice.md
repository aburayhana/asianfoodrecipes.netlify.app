recipeinstructions:
- "There is a wide variety of Japanese curry base! Vermont has mild/med hot/hot. Java has mild/med hot/hot/spicy. Find your favorite curry base combination!"
- "You can get English label packages in the US! If you have access to Jungle Jim&#39;s in Cincinnati, OH, you&#39;ll find them in the Japanese section. Fukushinzuke pickles are stored near the tofu too!"
- "Peel the potatoes, carrots, and onions. Cut those and the beef into bite size pieces. *It will be better to cut the potatoes bigger since they tend to become smaller as it stews."
- "Soak potatoes in water for 10 mins to remove scum."
- "Stir-fry vegetables with oil."
- "Add beef and stir-fry again."
- "Add water little by little and stir gently."
- "Put in the bay leaves. They have an effect to reduce the meat smell."
- "Place a paper kitchen towel on top to absorb any scum."

- "Stew again with low heat for 30 mins. *Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Remove the bay leaves after well stewed."
- "To soak the curry flavor well to all ingredients and make it richer, cool it down and then put in the refrigerator over night. *Do not leave at room temperature over night. Curry can easily get bad. Make sure to keep in the refrigerator!"
- "Or... If you want to eat right away on the day you cooked, cool down once and then heat again. &#34;Stew → cool down &amp; rest → stew&#34; is the best method to make this curry richer. But, I would say 2nd day curry is much better!"
- "To cool it down quickly, soak the pan in a bigger pan with cold water. Change the water several times as it becomes warm."
- "Heat the curry to serve. Put rice in a bowl, pour curry, add Fukushinzuke pickles and done!"
