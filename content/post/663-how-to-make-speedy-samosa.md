Hey everyone, it's me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, samosa. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Samosa is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions every day. Samosa is something which I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

A samosa (/ s É™ Ëˆ m oÊŠ s É™ /) is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, cheese, beef and other meats, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. The Indian style, often accompanied by a chutney, is probably the most widely known of a broad family of recipes from Africa to. These stuffed savory pastries are a traditional Indian favorite.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook samosa using 12 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.
