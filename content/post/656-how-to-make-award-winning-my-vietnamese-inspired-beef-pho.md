Pho is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street stalls and restaurants countrywide. Pho is considered Vietnam&#39;s national dish. I love how traditional Vietnamese cooking combines umami flavor (fish sauce, shrimp paste, and more) with copious amounts of fresh herbs. Basically I have a recommendation for authentic vietnamese pho. Go to your local oriental/world food mart and buy the actual pho broth cubes.
