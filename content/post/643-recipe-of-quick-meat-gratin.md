Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, meat gratin. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Meat Gratin is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look fantastic. Meat Gratin is something that I have loved my whole life.

And although it qualifies as a one-pan meal (with meat, green vegetable and starch altogether), a fresh and tangy green salad on the side would round things out nicely. Stir in the tomato paste and season to taste with salt and pepper. In order to beef up our gratin (pun intended), we decided to add some deliciously seasoned beef, along with some onion and garlic, and then pair it all together with deliciously creamy and cheesy potatoes. This recipe comes from a famous New Orleans restaurant but I don&#39;t remember which one!


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook meat gratin using 4 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you cook that.
