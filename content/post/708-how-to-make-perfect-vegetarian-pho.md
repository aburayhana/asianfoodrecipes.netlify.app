- "Pour the broth through a sieve or strainer in your serving bowl. Put noodles in the broth. Top with mushroom and pak choi mixture. Top with some cilantro and Thai basil, and a handful of bean sprouts. If you like it spicy, chop jalapeño and place on top with a squirt of sriracha!"

![Vegetarian Pho](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/a8cf885d0fc3408b/751x532cq70/vegetarian-pho-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hey everyone, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, vegetarian pho. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Place vegetable stock, onion, soy sauce, garlic, cinnamon sticks, ground ginger, star anise, and bay leaves in a large pot; bring to a boil. Traditionally, pho is made with strips of beef, and the broth is flavored with fish sauce. To make mine vegetarian, I substituted shiitake mushrooms for the beef and used tamari (or soy sauce) instead of the fish sauce. It&#39;s possible to have vegetarian pho with this broth made from soy sauce and a blend of spices like star anise and cinnamon.

Vegetarian Pho is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look wonderful. Vegetarian Pho is something which I have loved my entire life.

The broth, which picks up great flavor from the spices, a slight sweetness from the carrots, and the subtlest of charred aromas from the onion and ginger, is what truly makes this soup for me. I prefer keeping the toppings to a minimum so I can let the broth stand out and take center stage. Vegan Pho Ingredients: Alright, a few notes about ingredients before we get to the recipe.
