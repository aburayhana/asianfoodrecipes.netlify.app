![Vegetarian Pho](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/a8cf885d0fc3408b/751x532cq70/vegetarian-pho-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, vegetarian pho. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Place vegetable stock, onion, soy sauce, garlic, cinnamon sticks, ground ginger, star anise, and bay leaves in a large pot; bring to a boil. Traditionally, pho is made with strips of beef, and the broth is flavored with fish sauce. To make mine vegetarian, I substituted shiitake mushrooms for the beef and used tamari (or soy sauce) instead of the fish sauce. It&#39;s possible to have vegetarian pho with this broth made from soy sauce and a blend of spices like star anise and cinnamon.
