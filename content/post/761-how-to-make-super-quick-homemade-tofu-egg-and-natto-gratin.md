- "Put the Step 2 mixture in a gratin dish (an ovenproof dish), and top with the natto."
- "Add cheese on top. (I cut up some processed cheese, but, of course, you can use shredded pizza cheese instead.)"
- "Bake in a toaster oven or a 180°C oven for 10 to 15 minutes. When the egg has set, or the top has browned lightly, it&#39;s done."
