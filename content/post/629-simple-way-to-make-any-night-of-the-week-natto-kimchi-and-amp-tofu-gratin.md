Natto is a fermented food made by fermenting soybeans using bacteria called &#34;Bacillus subtilis&#34;.. (sliced dried bonito), kimchi, and raw eggs. Japanese people add either the whole raw egg or only the yolk, but for people from countries where consuming raw eggs isn&#39;t a normal occurrence, trying this with a sunny-side up egg might be a good. My sister in law is a Tokyo native and introduced me to natto a couple years back. I&#39;ve been into making fermented foods for the last ten or fifteen years (kimchi, all kinds of pickles, yogurt, kombucha, etc.) and it never dawned on me to try making natto until a couple weeks ago.
